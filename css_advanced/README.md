In this **README file**, I will implement
from scratch a **webpage** from a designer file.
For this project - **HTML, Advanced** - I will focus
on the *HTML Structure only*. Which means:

* no CSS,

* no style,

* just pure HTML Semantic.

**ALU** has provided us a designer file on **Figma**. So I have to 
create an account to access the final result and 
duplicate it to my drafts to have access to **all the design details.**

So wish me good luck!
:)

# First Task
1. Header
    Let’s start by the top: **the header**

    Here the wireframe of it:

    * Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)
    * In the body, add an header tag
    * Inside this header:
        * Add a link element with an image inside
        * Add a block of 3 link elements

# Second Task
2. The banner
    Under the header, add a main element with inside a section element.

    In this section element, add:

    * A block with inside:
       * An heading tag (don’t forget to use the correct heading value)
       * A text element
       * A button tag
    * Another block with inside:
       * Another heading tag (same, be careful about which one you are using)
       * A block containing 4 blocks - each block with inside:
       * An image
       * An heading tag
       * A text

Now we are doing the **CSS** styling for the **HTML** I did in the last project. Although, I do not have picture to show you the end project.

Wish me good luck :)
