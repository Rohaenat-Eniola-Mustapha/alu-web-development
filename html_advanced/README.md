In this **README file**, I will implement
from scratch a **webpage** from a designer file.
For this project - **HTML, Advanced** - I will focus
on the *HTML Structure only*. Which means:

* no CSS,

* no style,

* just pure HTML Semantic.

**ALU** has provided us a designer file on **Figma**. So I have to 
create an account to access the final result and 
duplicate it to my drafts to have access to **all the design details.**

So wish me good luck!
:)

# First Task
1. Header
Let’s start by the top: **the header**

Here the wireframe of it:

* Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)
* In the body, add an header tag
* Inside this header:
     * Add a link element with an image inside
     * Add a block of 3 link elements
