In this **README file**, I will implement
from scratch a **webpage** from a designer file.
For this project - **HTML, Advanced** - I will focus
on the *HTML Structure only*. Which means:

* no CSS,

* no style,

* just pure HTML Semantic.

**ALU** has provided us a designer file on **Figma**. So I have to 
create an account to access the final result and 
duplicate it to my drafts to have access to **all the design details.**

So wish me good luck!
:)
